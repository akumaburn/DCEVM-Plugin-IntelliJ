This is an [IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/akumaburn/DCEVM-IntelliJ-Plugin) which provides integration with **DCEVM - an OpenJDK-based JVM** that allows for **Java Hot Swapping**

Supports **JDK 11** and **WINDOWS 10 64bit** ONLY, if you wish to take development responsibility for other Operating Systems and JDK versions then please contact me on GitHub.

Default DCEVM DIR is:

	C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\DCEVM

If you have problems debugging this plugin, please first try to delete the contents of 

	C:\Users\$USER\.IdeaIC2019.3\system\plugins-sandbox
	C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\DCEVM

**BEFORE** filling an issue.

See [HotSwapAgent](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9552-hotswapagent/) for JDK8 integration.
